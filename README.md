# Comic-Sales-Stat-Compiler

Perl script to get information about comic book sales.

This reads html files from http://www.comichron.com/ and will compile some statistics based on sales numbers.

THINGS TO ADD:
1. Compile statistics such as average and standard deviation.
2. Command line arguments such as -p or -s to search for a specific publisher or series.
3. Output to files/stdout.
4. Scrape website directly without having to use html file.
